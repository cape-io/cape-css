# cape-style

Basic theme for cape.io, as well as a point of departure for some of the custom themes living in other sites... Styling for basic admin forms in CAPE eco-system lives here too.

- Put images in /public
- If you put logo.png in public it will be /theme/logo.png
- Put CSS in Styles folder
- CSS is currently formatted with LESS
- CSS ideology is like that of CSSzengarden â€” we have good, clean, well nested and classed (fairly) semantic HTML, you should be able to make any design you like with just the CSS as the "layout"
